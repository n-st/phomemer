# phomemer

## Docker container

Note: it's important to run with `--net=host`. This allows the container to
access bluetooth devices. Sadly, this will most likely only work under linux.

```
docker run -e PHOMEMO_BT_MAC=<your-printers-mac> --net=host -it ghcr.io/b4ckspace/phomemer
```

### USB connection

Instead of Bluetooth, you can also connect to your printer via USB.  
This should create a character device at `/dev/usb/lp0` (or a higher number).
You can pass this character device into the Docker container and omit the
`PHOMEMO_BT_MAC` setting to make phomemer use the USB connection.
(`PHOMEMO_BT_MAC` takes precedence over USB if it is specified!).

This requires that the Docker user has sufficient permission to write to
`/dev/usb/lp0` â€” assign the correct group membership or modify the character
device's permissions through a udev rule if not.

`--net=host` is still required here to allow you/your users to access phomemer
through a well-known port on the Docker host's localhost.

```
docker run --device '/dev/usb/lp0:/dev/phomemo' --net=host -it ghcr.io/b4ckspace/phomemer
```

## Docker compose

1. Copy .env.dist to .env and enter your printer address, with colons

(Without colons it will fail, ERROR 500)

```sh
docker compose up
```

## Local Development

```sh
PHOMEMO_BT_MAC=<your-printers-mac> poetry run flask \
  --app phomeme:app run \
  --debug --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Production

```sh
PHOMEMO_BT_MAC=<your-printers-mac> poetry run gunicorn -w 1 'phomeme:app' -b [::0]
```
